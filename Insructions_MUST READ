rough codes for various numerical methods for a pre determined polynomial function in C programming language has been uploaded by me to my repository if in need of help you can take code from their and port it in java
link - https://github.com/ArihantKumarSeraogi/Numerical-Analysis-via-C
Rules to be strictly followed-

1> do not use error values such as 0.0001 in case of bisection or raphson or regula falsi etc use the EPSILON notation
2> code body for the method should be STRICTLY INDENTED AND COMMENTED ..meaning the comments shoud make the code somewhat self explanatory in nature.
3> the METHODS WILL CATCH OBJECTS of polynomial class and return a answer value of double type Note: the polynomial class has already been defined and uploaded 
4> the ERROR TERM for the method should be tracked and calculated


(methods for which raw code has been uploaded and upon which work should begin immediately)
bisection method- Subhobroto (task assigned on 4th april) 
regula falsi method- 
newton raphson-
// secant method- Amit das (task assigned on 5th april)
