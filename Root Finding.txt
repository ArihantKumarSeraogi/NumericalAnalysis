#NumericalAnalysis

Applies to the following Root-FInding Methods
---------------------------------------------

Newton - Raphson (Depends on calcDerivative, calcError)
Secant Method(calcError)
Bisection Method
Regula Falsi(Depends on calcError)


For folks working on root finding methods, please note the special cases where the code should check whether real roots exist 
for the given polynomial. For instance, for bisection method, make sure the function changes sign on the interval given by 
the user. In case the initial test cases fail, the method should return an appropriate message and stop the operation.
