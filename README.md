# NumericalAnalysis

Hello everyone!

Welcome to our new Java repository. We intend to design and implement a math package which can be used for various calculations
involving numerical methods. Everything present in this repository right now is subject to change as we proceed with the
development process. The license set up for now is a regular GNU GPL. Read the terms if you wish. I will be adding the collaborators
to the list for this repository.

All the best! :-)
